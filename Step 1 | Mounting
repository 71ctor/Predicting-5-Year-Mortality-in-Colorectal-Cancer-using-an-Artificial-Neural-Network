AIC - 201 | The Dataset: SurGen SR386 Cohort (SR386_labels.csv) | Radit Srisathaporn (Vic)

#ANN Analysis for SR386
#This Google Collab walks through the complete process of building, evaluating, and improving a Neural Network to predict 5-year survival for colorectal cancer patients.

#Step 0: Setup Environment

#0.1: Mount Google Drive
#Connect Colab to your Google Drive to access the uploaded file (SR386_labels.csv).
print("--- Step 0.1: Mounting Google Drive ---")
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
print("Google Drive mounted successfully.")

#0.2: Import Necessary Libraries
#We will import all the packages we need at the start.
#pandas & numpy: For data loading and manipulation.
#matplotlib & seaborn: For plotting our graphs.
#sklearn: For data preprocessing (splitting, scaling, encoding) and evaluation (metrics).
#imblearn: For handling imbalanced data (SMOTE).
#tensorflow & keras: For building and training our neural network.
