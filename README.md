The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting 5-year mortality outcomes in colorectal cancer patients using the SurGen SR386 clinical cohort dataset.This project aims to demonstrate how supervised machine learning, specifically neural networks, can be applied to structured clinical data to support data-driven survival analysis. By learning patterns from patient attributes and clinical indicators, the model attempts to classify whether a patient is likely to survive beyond five years after diagnosis.

From an engineering perspective, this work focuses on:

- Building a reproducible ANN pipeline using Python and TensorFlow

- Applying proper data preprocessing, feature handling, and train–test splitting

- Evaluating model performance using appropriate classification metrics

- Understanding the strengths and limitations of neural networks in medical prediction tasks

Overall, this project serves as an educational and experimental study in applying AI techniques to healthcare data, rather than a clinical decision-making tool. The results highlight both the potential and the challenges of using neural networks for survival prediction in real-world biomedical datasets.
